# cocomoreTask
Hi, 
first of all, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity. I found your API-based task very useful and fun. 
Firstly, I did "requirement analysis" and tried to understand what is required in the given task. It was understandable to create, 
rename and delete a user in your task and I could easily saw them in the document (https://gorest.co.in/) which you provided. 
However, I could not find the body format in the given document to create a comment. 
For this reason, I asked you for an explanation and thank you very much that you did the necessary explanation. 
Then I started to write “Test Case’s” according to the requirements for add them to the "feature file”. 
My intention was to run the program on Cucumber. But as always, I had to do a Manual Test before I could see the scripts I was going to write.
I made the necessary queries in line with the "document" given in POSTMAN. When I saw the results successfully, I was able to start the automation.
And I created my FRAMEWORK as usual.

I decided to run my code with TESTNG first and then try it on cucumber. I've seen all the features work successfully in TESTNG.
Then I created the APITaskStepDefs class to run my test scripts on CUCUMBER as well. I observed that the test was done successfully on cucumbers.
 
Then I uploaded my framework to Github.
Thank you again for giving me this chance at your company.
