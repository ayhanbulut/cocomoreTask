# cocomoreTask
Hi, 
first of all, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity. I found your API-based task very useful and fun. 
Firstly, I did "requirement analysis" and tried to understand what is required in the given task. It was understandable to create, 
rename and delete a user in your task and I could easily saw them in the document (https://gorest.co.in/) which you provided. 
However, I could not find the body format in the given document to create a comment. 
For this reason, I asked you for an explanation and thank you very much that you did the necessary explanation. 
Then I started to write “Test Case’s” according to the requirements for add them to the "feature file”. 
My intention was to run the program on the Cucumber. But as always, I had to do a Manual Test first so I could see the scripts I would write. 
I made the necessary queries in POSTMAN according to the given "document". When I saw the results with success, I could start automations. 
And I created my FRAMEWORK as usual. I wrote my test codes under stepDef file. I created APITaskStepDefs class. But for some reason what I don't understand, 
the Cucumber file did not execute. I decided to run my codes with TESTNG in order to try it on cucumber later. I have seen all the features work successfully in TESTNG. 
But unfortunately, no time to try them on Cucumber. But i will try to do it later. 
Then I uploaded my framework to Github. 
Thank you again for giving me this chance at your company.
